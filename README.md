# Doreen Wiggins
I am a Jr. Developer who is passionate about writing clean, reusable code that improves the user experience!

## About Me
I completed the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at UNH, and have a BA in Mathematics.  
In my years spent as a Bank Manager, I have become an expert at problem solving and thinking outside the box.  When I used the bank software I would often think of ways it could be more intuitive and user friendly.
Fast forward to my next job as a Jr. Data Engineer at Recordsforce where I was on the team to test and give feedback on the new version of their PACE software.  When PACE was sold to outside companies I was responsible for conducting the new user training.  I also developed some standard and custom reports using SQL Server/SSMS and Telerik Report Designer.
